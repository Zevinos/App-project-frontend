# Great Games App project üïπÔ∏è

Second project project.

## What is it ?

It's a react application made during the IRONHACK Bootcamp.

The objective was to create a single page application in React using an API with requests.

## Why did i choose this theme ?

I love playing video games so i thougth it would be a good idea to do somekind of a library where you can find games and get more info about them.

## Features

- You can create games and add them to the games list via a form
- A favorite list to put the games that you like

## Issues

-Not responsive so not suitable for phones or tablets for the moment
